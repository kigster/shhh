#
# == Using Sym Library
#
# This library is a "wrapper" that allows you to take advantage of the
# symmetric encryption functionality provided by the {OpenSSL} gem (and the
# underlying C library). In order to use the library in your ruby classes, you
# should _include_ the module {Sym}.
#
# The including class is decorated with four instance methods from the
# module {Sym::Extensions::InstanceMethods} and two class methods from
# {Sym::Extensions::ClassMethods} â€“ for specifics, please refer there.
#
# The two main instance methods are +#encr+ and +#decr+, which as the name
# implies, perform two-way symmetric encryption and decryption of any Ruby object
# that can be +marshaled+.
#
# Two additional instance methods +#encr_password+ and +#decr_password+ turn on
# password-based encryption, which actually uses a password to construct a 128-bit
# long private key, and then uses that in the encryption of the data.
# You could use them to encrypt data with a password instead of a randomly
# generated private key.
#
# The library comes with a rich CLI interface, which is mostly encapsulated under the
# +Sym::App+ namespace.
#
# The +sym+ executable that is the "app" in this case, and is a _user_ of the
# API methods +#encr+ and +#decr+.
#
# Create a new key with +#create_private_key+ class method, which returns a new
# key every time it's called, or with +#private_key+ class method, which either
# assigns, or creates and caches the private key at a class level.
#
# == Example
#
#     require 'sym'
#
#     class TestClass
#       include Sym::Crypt
#       # read the key from environmant variable and assign to this class.
#       private_key ENV['PRIVATE_KEY']
#
#       def sensitive_value=(value)
#         @sensitive_value = encr(value, self.class.private_key)
#       end
#
#       def sensitive_value
#         decr(@sensitive_value, self.class.private_key)
#       end
#     end
#
# == Private Key
#
# They private key can be generated by +TestClass.create_private_key+
# which returns but does not store a new random 256-bit key.
#
# The key can be assigned and saved, or auto-generated and saved using the
# +#private_key+ method on the class that includes the +Sym+ module.
#
# Each class including the +Sym+ module would get their own +#private_key#
# class-instance variable accessor, and a possible value.
